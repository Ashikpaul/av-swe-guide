# Autonomous Vehicle Software Development Guide :car:
Welcome! This is the ultimate autonomous vehicles guide for all **computer science students**, **software engineers**, or those looking to develop foundational skills for *autonomous vehicle software development*. As an open source project that is continuously updating and improving, we are hoping to provide high-quality, free education for those interested in learning more about autonomous vehicle software development. 

> An autonomous car is a vehicle capable of sensing its environment and operating without human involvement. A human passenger is not required to take control of the vehicle at any time, nor is a human passenger required to be present in the vehicle at all. An autonomous car can go anywhere a traditional car goes and do everything that an experienced human driver does.
