# Autonomous Vehicles Software Development Guide :car:
Welcome! This is the ultimate autonomous vehicles guide for all **computer science students**, **software engineers**, or those looking to develop foundational skills for *autonomous vehicle software development*. As an open source project that is continuously updating and improving, we are hoping to provide high-quality, free education for those interested in learning more about autonomous vehicle software development. 

> An autonomous car is a vehicle capable of sensing its environment and operating without human involvement. A human passenger is not required to take control of the vehicle at any time, nor is a human passenger required to be present in the vehicle at all. An autonomous car can go anywhere a traditional car goes and do everything that an experienced human driver does.

# Why Autonomous Vehicles?
Maybe you like cars. Maybe you want to find work. Maybe you want to define the future of autonomy. Maybe you want to create a personal project for your resume. Regardless of your purpose for starting this guide, there are four key things I want to highlight that should be a part of your *why*. 

## Motivation :muscle: ##
> "*Whether you think you can, or think you can't, you're right*." - Henry Ford

> "*Self-driving cars are the natural extension of active safety and obviously something we should do*." - Elon Musk

Autonomous vehicle research and development is really cool work. And I mean really cool. Whether you like it or not, we are not very far away from fleets of AVs ruling the roads. We are still many years away, but this is the best time to contribute to this growing field. 

## The Future :zap: ##
Like stated above, fleets of fully autonomous vehicles will become a reality in the future (~ 10-20 years), and designing, developing, and building the tools and software behind these machines is work that will be monumental in the future. And you can get started making an impact today. 

## Safety is Critical :vertical_traffic_light: ##
One of the most important factors in developing autonomous vehicles, or any autonomous system for that matter, is safety. Remember this, safety is critical, safety is critical, safety is critial. There are safety standards in place, however, there are still so many edge scenarios and possible situations, objects, etc that developers and companies need to continuously account for. Essentially, there is no bound to what can occur. Between pedestrians sprinting acorss the street, human driver on autonmous driver accidents, and more, it is important to design and develop for safety. This is the main factor that is preventing fleets of autonomous vehicles from hitting the road today. 

## High Impact Work :arrow_up_small: ##
And lastly, this is high impact work for you as a computer science student and software engineer. Yeah it's cool to create an app, yeah it's cool to work for FaceBook, but nothing beats real, high impact work, and working on autonomous vehicles is one such example.


# Getting Started & Pre-requisites
For those who are computer science students at a university or a software engineer, it is assumed you have basic data structures and algorthms knowledge. Regardless, this learning guide is for everyone, so below, I have compiled basic knowledge that is important before embarking on this awesome guide.
